## [Unreleased]
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed

## [3.0.5]
### Added/Changed
- macos arm (aarch64) build

### Fixed
- add extra check for valid folder setting when importing dat
- fix macos intel (x64) build

- nullpointer since jetty 12 for webclient bundled in a jar mode used by some distribution type (docker and nogui-noarch) 

### Changed
- update jdk to 21.0.3+9


## [3.0.3]
### Fixed
- jdk.zipfs was missing in bundled JDK packages

### Changed
- update jdk to 21.0.2+13


## [3.0.2]
### Fixed
- zip4j's rename is malfunctioning (it renames too much), switched back to jdk's ZipFileSystem for this operation while waiting our submitted PR to be merged and a new zip4j version released


## [3.0.1]
### Fixed
- Urgent fix for "Comparison method violates its general contract!" on Report entries sorting 


## [3.0.0]
### Added/Changed
- See all previous 3.0.0 beta versions

### Fixed
- Save and load last used dir for each file chooser usage on javafx version
- Mame samples were missed when in subfolders of src dirs (and there is no hash to retrieve them)
- Occasional problem when renaming an entry in a zip archive
- Some unneeded containers were not removed
- Reports were not sorted


## [3.0.0-beta.20]
### Added
- Selection per machine/software in profile viewer is now saved in profile settings and so : can be exported/imported. This new feature will greatly increase .properties size (from a few KB to a few MB) and *may* impact a bit on profile loading/saving performance on small systems
- Exclusion list for web interface
- Checkbox for zero_entry_matters property

### Changed
- Use keep a Changelog format for this document
- Web server version only : avoid to send all filter settings (already implicitly sent thru lists data)

### Fixed
- Performance problems on filters selection when ProfileViewer is open : its update is now asynchronous and done only once when doing successive selections/un-selections
- Profile Viewer was not updating in web version when opened and nplayer/catver items were (de)selected
- System filters were resetting to false in web version when changing of profile
- Some mistakes in settings name, the fix implies that some settings may have been reset in filters, you have been warned
- Exclusion list was not functional


## [3.0.0-beta.19]
### Fixed
- Fix in getBaseName : can't use FileNameUtils.getBaseName(file) from Apache commons, it's way too basic and can remove extensions on names which contains some dots but are not really there for an extension (for ex : "Daisenryaku (1991)(Hiro Co.)(JP)[o4]" is becoming "Daisenryaku (1991)(Hiro Co"), so I made instead a regex pattern matching defining extension as only letters and digits and not more than 5 characters and not less than 1 (excluding .) at the end of file name. What's the purpose of this getBaseName normalizer ? It's all fault of some DAT for which games name have extension in name. If it still gives problem then the next step will be probably to set it optional per profile...


## [3.0.0-beta.18]
### Fixed
- Fix NULL Pointer Exception on file/dir chooser when there is no default directory
- CatVer and NPlayers filters were not loading properly


## [3.0.0-beta.17]
### Changed
- Use of virtual threads. This means that *Max available* CPU setting can go up to 256 vThreads, and *Adaptive* CPU setting can go up to twice the avail processors on your machine. But even with other settings this should benefit a little.
- Progress window auto extend dynamically as soon as there is more simultaneous threads
- Internal setting zero_entry_matters which default to true and consider that a zero size entry (with CRC to 0) should not be ignored and be created. Creation still needs a zero file somewhere as source for the moment. Setting in GUI will come later


## [3.0.0-beta.16]
### Fixed
- Optimization when showing/filtering profile viewer machines in merge mode


## [3.0.0-beta.15]

- fixed sha1 scan miss (whatever rom is suspicious or unconditional sha1 calculation was enabled)


## [3.0.0-beta.1]
3.x milestone is an attempt to simplify the whole project since it was becoming more and more unmanageable
### Changed
- Java 17 is now required
- JavaFX 17 gui is the new desktop standard interface, as a replacement of the outdated swing interface
- src archive is removed, to compile from sources => ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/optyfr/JRomManager.git``
- modularization (jigsaw) has been dropped, it give far more problems and constraints than features
- zip4j is replacing the hacked Zip File System Provider, it should be able to add/delete entries into a zip without overall archive recompression
- possibility to skip during scan dirs or files using glob list (not yet functional)
- Warning : No desktop gui for noarch/all/zip builds since javafx is hardware/os dependent, you'll have to use arch specific packages/installers, for uncommon os/hardware it'll be web or cli mode


## [2.5.0]
### Changed
- Java 11 is now a minimal source/target requirement
- Dropped obsolete/unmaintained NanoHTTPd, and using only Jetty
- Modularized code and dependencies to bundle inside a designated java runtime that target some specific platforms (currently JRE11 + Windows_64)
- Rebranded MSI installer for windows (using jpackage from Java 14+)
- More informative about what's invalid in a datfile when it can't be loaded


## [2.4.4]
### Fixed
- Dummy release because 2.4.3 packages were build with wrong jdk...


## [2.4.3]
### Fixed
- Property fixes with WebClient
- Better RemoteFileChooser handling for BatchTools in WebClient


## [2.4.2]
### Fixed
- Fixed "dry run" bug for server mode
- Certs dir was missing (was only in zip version)
- Rescan after fix in batch mode


## [2.4.1]
### Fixed
- Fixed wrong packaging for webclient
- Included a self signed "localhost" certificate for full server mode HTTPS


## [2.4.0]
**This will be the last version supporting Java 8, next one will require at least Java 11**
### Added
- Added full server mode
    - Made for an usage over the Internet (but it should be kept legal between users)
    - Jetty is used instead of NanoHTTPd
    - Multi-user with access rights, a per user WorkDir, a shared read-only space, and no access to the rest of the entire FileSystem
    - Totally secured (separate accounts with login/password, HTTPS with TLS 1.3, server certificate handling and auto reload, obfuscated paths, ...)
    - HTTP2 support (only with TLS 1.2) which permit long polling request usage in place of WebSockets without loosing too much network performance
    - This mode is still **experimental**, work still need to be made on disk/thread quotas, and a firewall with IP filtering may be required to get full control on who is attempting to connect 
- Implemented Long polling Request as alternative of WebSockets for simple server mode
- New "Single File" mode, made for single ROM per game sets than can be kept in base directory without creating a sub-directory for each game...
- Added support for import/export of settings from one profile to another
- More graphical icons for tabs and buttons

- CLI version
    - include access to all functionalities and more
    - support for environment variables (replacement) and java system properties (replacement, set, and clear)
- Modularized building which permit special packages for server and cli excluding all code from standalone interface (swing)
    - Most of the code were refactored and reorganized to get a total separation from core and standalone code


## [2.1.0]
### Added
- RAR4 extraction
- RAR4 and 7Zip multi-volume extraction
- Included ARM for sevenzipjbinding
- Fully functional on Raspberry PI
### Changed
- Service is now configured for a maximum of 75% percentage of memory instead of a fixed size of 4GB, this should resolve launching problems on low memory devices
### Fixed
- Better accuracy of progress bars and times estimations (now also according data size to process)
- Better multiprocessor scheduler : tasks are sorted first then distributed dynamically (instead of using a spliterator)
- Many fixes and speed enhancements


## [2.0.4]

### Added
- Added Mac OS X DMG package


## [2.0.0]
### Added
- New naming scheme
- Batch Compressor : to compress many files at a time from any format to Zip, TrntZip, or 7ZIP 
- Server mode + Web Client (EXPERIMENTAL).
    - JRomManager can listen to a defined port and serve a web interface instead of the classical Swing gui
    - The initial purpose of the server mode is to run JRomManager on headless server and directly on NAS
    - The Web interface is full feature complete, and very powerful, thanks to SmartGWT from isomorphic
    - This feature is **experimental**, it means that :
        - It has not been tested over the internet => the purpose is to access from intranet
        - It's a simple web server with basic websockets support => proxies may not work, no encrypted connection (https/wss), no protection against DDOS, no connection limitations, ...
        - There is currently no multiuser support nor access control implemented => you can break your server easily if you don't know what you're doing
    - See the [wiki](https://github.com/optyfr/JRomManager/wiki/Server-mode#server-mode) for more informations on server mode and web client

### Fixed
- Fixed [issue #17](https://github.com/optyfr/JRomManager/issues/17)
- Various fixes (and maybe new bugs?) implied by some code rework for server mode


## [1.9b29]
### Added
- Enhancements  
    - Custom scan settings for dir updater batch tool
    - Details and Report lists in Batch dir updater
    - Torrent checker is able to detect wrongly archived folders and unzip them
    - Created our own overlay for Gentoo Linux, releases will be in sync for this distribution :
        - add the overlay using command `layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optyfr/jrommanager-gentoo/master/overlay.xml -f -a jrommanager`
        - to keep in sync use `layman -s jrommanager`
- Minor enhancements  
    - Torrent checker can now delete useless files and wrong files  
    - Report log now include datetime in its name and does not overwrite the former log  
    - Report log now include informations about originating dat/xml file and used scan settings 
    - Added file selectors to Dir Updater and Torrent checker (drag & drop alternative)

### Fixed
- Added tooltips in table headers (batch tools and profile viewer)
- Bad Zip64 reading header
- Performance problem with machines with lot of roms (and so archives with lot of entries to compare to)


## [1.8b28]
### Fixed
- Edge case found in scanner when two roms in same set need to be swapped (was resulting in removing one of the roms)
- Does not report wrong hash entry when it is fixable (and will be fixed), so that "dry run" mode return good fixed count
- More explicit result when torrent checking is successful
- Made multithreaded progress interface more robust, because it may be wrong under Linux as thread IDs are not reused like on windows 


## [1.8b27]
### Fixed
- pop-up menu was missing in torrent checker, so that deleting entries was impossible
- torrent checking was unstoppable
- out of <workdir> dats (batch tools case) won't have anymore their cache, properties, and nfo files saved with them but instead they will be stored in <workdir>/work special dir

### Added
- Minor enhancements
    - Multithreading enabled for torrent checker
    - Individual selection for torrent check and directories updater
    - added hints in batch tools tables


## [1.8b26]
### Added
- Dir2Dat
- Batch Tools
    - Dir Updater : to update many dats files to many dirs. Accept dirs of dats as source (software list mode)
    - Torrent checker : to check many torrent to many dirs. From file name mode to sha1 mode


## [1.7b24]
### Added
- Executable launcher for windows (using [JLauncher](https://github.com/optyfr/JLauncher) project)
- Documented source code and javadoc archive available
- Available in Gentoo Linux repository 

### Fixed
- Fixed licensing issues (with the help of Michał Górny from Gentoo)
- Fixed problem with SevenzipJBinding initialization temporary directory 


## [1.6b20]
### Added
- Machine/Software can individually (de)selected in Profile Viewer, this will impact the scan and filtered export
- Possibility to auto(de)select by keywords,
    - keywords list is built with all terms between parenthesis in each description
    - keywords selection interface permit to choose which keywords is accepted and by order of priority
    - autoselection will do the best to select only one game with the same name without keywords, and based upon keywords preference order (so that 1G1R and more should be possible this way)
- backup profile option : Each deleted rom will be stored in a backup folder which is reused upon future scans, so that roms are never loose (but eat some disk space)
- load device descriptions from profile to launch softwares with the correct media
- there is now 2 launch options (made for packaging via official linux distribution tools) :
    - --multiuser : set working folder inside home directory instead of app directory
    - --noupdate : disable search for update 
- documentation available on [github wiki](https://github.com/optyfr/JRomManager/wiki)

### Fixed
- fixed wrongly unneeded files when software list is present in profile
- fixed problem with progress bar when thread id changed in between two parallel streams
- fixed stupid problem with dat containing uppercase crc/sha1/md5 (thanks go to SpaceAgeHero)

- package for ArchLinux available on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jrommanager/)


## [1.5b18]
### Added
- New progress bar which show multithreaded operations separately
- Added intermediate progression for fix operations and TorrentZipping
- HalfDumb mode (also known as PD Mame merged mode), works a bit better
but still only 99.8% torrent join
- Rom reading order is now kept
- Added menu shortcut Presets on scanner settings panel
- new Non-Merge mode which include devices (PD Mame Non-Merged mode)
- new options to exclude games and machines and to generate bios/devices only sets, or machine/bios/devices only sets
- network access fix for zipfilesystem

### Fixed
- Fixed status in profile viewer (again) for files with same crc in same
dir but one is not present (should be green)
- added an extra "media" argument on command line to launch a software available for the same computer in multiple format (floppy, cartridge, tape, ...)
- avoid extra torrentzip check when not needed
- don't create empty folders for software list until we find roms or chds to put in 
- chd files were not anymore refreshed in profile viewer
- New merge hash collision option called that will also make subirs for clone for chds
- JUpdater does not cause fail and quit anymore when connect timeout on update url
- JUpdater is now copying attributes, that should resolve problem encountered to launch .sh


## [1.4b16]
### Added
- ZipFileSystem class from JRE has problem with file modification over shared network, it pretends that archive file is not writable while it is, so it's time to duplicate Oracle's code into JRomManager... and patch it!
- As a consequence ZipFileSystem has also been enhanced to support compression level (from STORE[0] to ULTRA[9]) instead of the DEFAULT[-1] compression
- It is also now possible to choose a size threshold where ZipFileSystem will choose between uncompress to RAM or to temporary folder  
- Now that we have full control on ZipFileSystem behavior, ZIP compression level will be automatically set to 1 prior TorrentZipping
- When launching a software from Profile Viewer you will have choice of the machine (sorted by compatibility level)
- Samples are also TorrentZipped now

### Fixed
- Fixed an out of bound stream bug with Jtrrntzip when reading STORE files from archive (that was returning a CorruptZip code)


## [1.4b15]
### Added
- Added update check at start with ChangeLog diff (from current to latest) shown in a MessageDialog (English only)
- Added one-click updater: just click the link in the MessageDialog from update checker, and it will download and update by itself, then restart using [JUpdater](https://github.com/optyfr/JUpdater)
- Added Jar Installer: just download the Jar version from [github](https://github.com/optyfr/JRomManager/releases/latest) and run it with Java
- Added System's filter new shortcuts menu

### Fixed
- Fixed software list refresh bug in profile viewer
- Fixed special case of ROMs with no name (and with loadflag)

## [1.3b13]
### Fixed
- Resources folders were missing in jar


## [1.3b12]
### Fixed
- Unknown containers checking was not filtered

### Changed
- Code is now compilable with jdk 9/10 (but still jdk 8 compatible)
- Migrated java eclipse project to gradle nature project (no more manual download of dependencies needed)


## [1.3b10]
### Added
- Export to logiqx datafile, Mame dat, Mame SW List
- Export all/selected + filtered/unfiltered
- Basic filter by Min/Max year
- Advanced filtering:
    - Filter by categories/subcategories using catver.ini (with an extra menu shortcut for mature exclusion/inclusion)

- More Drag & Drop
- Added Samples support
- Various code cleanups and optimizations


## [1.2b8]
### Added

    - Roms are displayed with software lists in profile viewer
    - There is a jrm profile format (xml inside), that tell where to find the two mame xml files (roms + swlists)
    - Roms ans SWLists are scanned at the same time
    - There is now an optional software dir and an even more optional software disks dir
- Double click on game name in profile viewer will launch game if (Mame is linked with profile and item is green)
- Double click on software name in profile viewer will launch software with a valid machine (if Mame is linked with profile and item is green)
- Double click on cloneof or romof item in profile viewer will jump to that item definition
- Search field in profile viewer
- Complete profile manager with stats
- TorrentZip support is now integrated and optimized (with [Jtrrntzip](https://github.com/optyfr/Jtrrntzip))
- Optional Separate Dest dir between Roms, CHDs, Software Roms, Software CHDs
- Option to ignore unknown containers
- Option to ignore unneeded containers
- Option to ignore unneeded entries
- Option to do implicit merging (like ClrMamePro)
- Drag & Drop on src/dest dirs controls
