This beta release include a major refactoring regarding sonarqube code quality recommandations, some bugs may be fixed, some other might have been created...
There is still some work to do before 2.5.0 final release :
- fix webclient regarding sonarqube recommandation
- create junit auto tests for code coverage
For the unit tests, I would like to use some roms/chd to test, but most of these are not free to use... so if you have any suggestion or sources for legal test roms and chds, I'm more than interested!
