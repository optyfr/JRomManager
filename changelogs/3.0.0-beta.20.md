### Added
- Selection per machine/software in profile viewer is now saved in profile settings and so : can be exported/imported. This new feature will greatly increase .properties size (from a few KB to a few MB) and *may* impact a bit on profile loading/saving performance on small systems
- Exclusion list for web interface
- Checkbox for zero_entry_matters property

### Changed
- Use keep a Changelog format for this document
- Web server version only : avoid to send all filter settings (already implicitly sent thru lists data)

### Fixed
- Performance problems on filters selection when ProfileViewer is open : its update is now asynchronous and done only once when doing successive selections/un-selections
- Profile Viewer was not updating in web version when opened and nplayer/catver items were (de)selected
- System filters were resetting to false in web version when changing of profile
- Some mistakes in settings name, the fix implies that some settings may have been reset in filters, you have been warned
- Exclusion list was not functional
