### Added
- Selection per machine/software in profile viewer is now saved in profile settings and so : can be exported/imported. This new feature will greatly increase .properties size (from a few KB to a few MB) and *may* impact a bit on profile loading/saving performance on small systems

### Changed
- Use keep a Changelog format for this document

### Fixed
- Performance problems on filters selection when ProfileViewer is open : its update is now asynchronous and done only once when doing successive selections/un-selections
