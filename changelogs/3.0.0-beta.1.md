- 3.x milestone is an attempt to simplify the whole project since it was becoming more and more unmanageable
- Java 17 is now required
- JavaFX 17 gui is the new desktop standard interface, as a replacement of the outdated swing interface
- src archive is removed, to compile from sources => ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/optyfr/JRomManager.git``
- modularization (jigsaw) has been dropped, it give far more problems and constraints than features
- zip4j is replacing the hacked Zip File System Provider, it should be able to add/delete entries into a zip without overall archive recompression
- possibility to skip during scan dirs or files using glob list (not yet functional)
- Warning : No desktop gui for noarch/all/zip builds since javafx is hardware/os dependent, you'll have to use arch specific packages/installers, for uncommon os/hardware it'll be web or cli mode
