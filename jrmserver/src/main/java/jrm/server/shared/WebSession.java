/**
 * Represents a web session for a client connected to the JRomManager server.
 * This class extends {@link Session} to provide web-specific functionality,
 * including long-polling message queues, worker thread management, and
 * caching of profile and compressor lists.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each web session is associated with an HTTP session and maintains state
 * information such as:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A blocking deque for asynchronous message delivery to the client via
 * long-polling</li>
 * <li>A reference to the worker thread performing background operations for
 * this session</li>
 * <li>Temporary report objects for scan results and torrent check operations</li>
 * <li>Cached profile and compressor lists for efficient access during batch
 * operations</li>
 * <li>Timestamp tracking for session expiration and inactivity detection</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Web sessions are managed in a global registry ({@link #allSessions}) that
 * allows the server to track all active sessions and perform bulk operations
 * such as graceful shutdown. When a session is closed (either due to client
 * disconnect or server shutdown), it removes itself from this registry and
 * signals any waiting long-polling clients.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class implements both {@link Closeable} and {@link Serializable} to
 * support proper resource cleanup and session persistence across server
 * restarts. Transient fields (worker thread, temporary reports, and caches)
 * are not serialized and must be reinitialized after deserialization.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.0
 * @see Session
 * @see Worker
 * @see Closeable
