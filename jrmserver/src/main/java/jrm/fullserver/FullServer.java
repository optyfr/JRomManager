/**
 * FullServer is the main class for the jrm full server application. It extends AbstractServer and provides functionality to
 * initialize and start a Jetty server with support for HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 protocols. The server is configured using
 * command-line arguments and environment properties, allowing for flexible setup of various parameters such as ports, bind address,
 * connection limits, and SSL certificate paths.
 * <p>
 * The class includes methods for parsing command-line arguments, setting up SSL context for HTTPS connections, configuring security
 * handlers for authentication, and managing server connectors for different protocols. It also includes a main method that serves
 * as the entry point for the application, allowing it to be run as a standalone server or as a Windows service.
