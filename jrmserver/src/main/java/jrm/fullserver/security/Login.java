/**
 * Login service for the Jetty server.

 * It uses a database to store user credentials and roles, and provides methods for logging in, validating user identities, and
 * logging out. The class also includes a caching mechanism to improve performance by storing user identities in memory for a short
 * period of time. The login method checks the provided credentials against the stored credentials in the database and creates a
 * UserIdentity object if the credentials are valid. The validate method checks if a UserIdentity is valid by checking the cache,
 * and the logout method removes the UserIdentity from the cache. The class also includes a default admin user that is created if
 * the users table is empty.

     * <p>
     * Note: The actual implementation of the login logic is delegated to a private login method that takes the username,

     * the login logic while still adhering to the LoginService interface requirements.

     * allowing for session-based authentication and authorization in subsequent requests.
     * <p>
     * Note: It is important to ensure that the credentials provided by the user are properly validated and sanitized to prevent
     * security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or other types of attacks. The CryptCredential class should be implemented
     * securely to handle password hashing and verification, and the database queries should be parameterized to prevent SQL
     * injection. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented to handle potential exceptions that may occur during the
     * login process, such as database access errors or other I/O issues, to ensure that the application can gracefully handle
     * errors and provide appropriate feedback to the user or administrator.
     * <p>
     * The method is designed to be thread-safe by synchronizing on the cache when accessing and modifying it. This ensures that
     * multiple concurrent login attempts do not cause race conditions or other issues with the cache, which could lead to
     * inconsistent behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is important to ensure that the synchronization is properly implemented
     * to maintain the integrity of the cache and prevent potential issues with concurrent access.
     * <p>
     * Note: The method assumes that the credentials provided by the user are in a format that can be checked against the stored
     * credentials in the database using the CryptCredential class. It is important to ensure that the credentials are properly
     * formatted and validated before being passed to this method to prevent issues with authentication and ensure that only valid
     * credentials are accepted for login.
     * <p>
     * The method also assumes that the Request object provided contains the necessary information to retrieve the session ID and
     * manage the session for the login process. It is important to ensure that the Request object is properly constructed and
     * contains the required information for session management to ensure that the login process works correctly and securely.
     * <p>
     * Note: The method may need to be modified or extended in the future to support additional authentication mechanisms, such as
     * multi-factor authentication or integration with external identity providers. It is important to design the login logic in a
